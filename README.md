Tweets every hour and can reply. Favorites 'interesting' tweets (i.e., those that contain one of the bot's top 100 words). Replies to 10 recent tweets containing "Dr Bronner's" every 12 hours.

Source text comes from every Dr. Bronner's liquid soap label (at least all those available [here](https://www.drbronner.com/our-story/timeline/read-the-moral-abcs/)). Identical phrases between bottles have been omitted for greater diversity. All source text was typed by hand (except Peppermint, which I found transcribed as a part of [THE DR.BRONNER ALL-ONE TYPOGRAPHY CHALLENGE!](http://all-one-typography.com/)).

Work in progress.

Made with the help of [twitter_ebooks](https://github.com/mispy/twitter_ebooks) and Emanuel H. Bronner.
