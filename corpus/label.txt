Thank God we don't descend down from perfect Adam & EVe to sinful sinner, Brother's Keeper, divided slave!
United, hardworking-trained-brave, from dust we ascend up!
Thank God for that!
Our Brother's Teacher of the Moral ABC mason Hillel taught carpenter Jesus to unite all mankind free!

From '29 to '44, soapmaker-master-chemist Bronner built 3 American soap plants, trained 9 chemists, licensed 6 of 53 patients for $60,000!
But after '44, after losing father-mother-wife, almost his own life, tortured-blinded, he deeded to African astronomer Israel's 6000 year great All-One-God-Faith all of his patents, plants, products, profits.
4 new industries: 13 Essene Birth-Control patents, Planetemples & "Town Without Toothache" potassium-soda industry giving mankind a new Mineral-salt, Calcium-malt, Corn-sesame, Mineral-bouillon, & 'Dr.
Bronner's Magic Soaps', All-One!
In '47, after father-mother-wife murdered, ourself tortured-blinded, we wrote this poem: To keep my health!
To do my work!
To love, to live!
To see to it!
I gain & grow * give!
Never to look behind me for an hour!
Never to wait in weakness nor to brag in power!
Always working, searching for more truth, more light!
Always writing, teaching what I found good & right!
Robbed-starved-beaten-blinded, wide astray!
Back with the full-truth I've gained, back to the way: Smile, help teach the whole Human race, the Moral ABC of All-One-God-Faith, Lightning-like strong & we're All-One!
All-One!

If you can keep your head when all around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you!
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, and yet make allowance for their doubting too!
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about, don't deal in lies!
Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise!
If you can dream and not make dreams your master!
If you can think and not make thoughts your aim!
If you can meet with triumph or disaster and treat those two imposters just the same!
If you can bear to hear the full-truth you have spoken twisted by crooks to make a trap for fools!
Or watch the things that you have given your life to broken, and stoop to build them up again with worn out tools!
If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it at one turn of pitch or toss!
And lose and start again at your beginnings and never breath a word about your loss!
If you can force your heart, your nerve, your sinew, to serve you long after they are gone!
And so hold on although there is nothing left within you except that voice that says to them "Hold on!
Hold on!" If you can talk to crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings and not lose that common touch!
If neither loving friend nor enemy can hurt you; if all men count with you, but none too much!
If you can work hard to teach each unforgiving minute the Moral ABC, mason Hillel taught carpenter Jesus to unite all mankind free, come hell, hate, ban, you'll enjoy God's spaceship Earth & do great work within it; & which is more my son, you'll be man!
A man!
Supre, East is east and West is West and never the twain shall meet!
But there is neither East nor West, nor border, breed nor birth, once the Moral ABC unites all mankind free on God's spaceship Earth!
Then & only then, no matter how rough the trip, how charged the scroll, you ar9e the captain of thy ship, the master of thy soul!
These are the days my friend, we know they'll never end!
We'll work, sing, dance, love, maching on!
Marching on!
We live God's law today!@ We win Free speech OK!
With full-truth, our only God, we rally, raise, unite the whole human race, lightning-like, in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-YFaith!
As teaches the African astronomer Israel since the year One: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!" "Excepetions eternally?
Absolute none!"

To dream the impossible dream!
To reach that unreachable star!
'til All-One, All-One we are!
To fight that unbeatable foe!
To go where the brave dare not go!
To right the unrightable wrong!
To love pure, chaste, from afar!
To try when your arms are too weary!
'til All-One, All-One we are!
For this is my goal!
To reach that unreachable star.
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far!
To fight for the right without question or pause, to be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause!
For I know that if I follow this glorious quest, my heart will lie peaceful & calm when I'm laid to my rest!
And I know that the world will be better for this, that one man, tortured, blinded, covered with scars, still strove with his last ounce of courage, to reach that unreachable star 'til united All-One, All-One we are!

A fire, a mist, a planet, a crystal & a cell; a jellyfish, a dinosaur, caves where cavemen dwell!
Then, a sense for work-love-song-art-law-play-beauty, a face turned up from the sod!
Sure, it's constructive-evolution, guided by One, ever-recreating God!
One almighty, all-embracing, ever-loving, ever-evolving Eternal Father, guiding all mankind up from dust, driven by hungers, half-true hate, up by hard work, full-truth, great love, song-speech-&-Profitsharing State, up into the Kingdom, the dictatorship of God's law uniting All-One-God-Faith; "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternal One!" Exceptions?
None!
Thank God we don't descend down from perfect Adam & Eve to sinful sinner.
Brother's Keeper, divided slave!
United-brave, from dust we ascend up!
Thank God for that!
Our Brother's Teacher of the Moral ABC, Hillel taught Jesus to unite all mankind free: 1st: perfect thyself!
2nd: work brave!
3rd: unite to help teach all, every slave, the Moral ABC, lightning-like 6 billion strong & we're All-One, as astronomer Israel teaches "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternal One!" Exceptions?
None!

1st: If I'm not me, who am I?
Nobody!
2nd: yet, if I'm only for me, what am I?
Nothing!
3rd: If not now, when?
Once more: Unless constructive-selfish I work hard perfecting first me, absolute nothing can help perfect me!!
4th: Only hard work - God's law can save us, but if we teach only our clan?
We're all hated then!
So, we must teach friend & enemy, the whole Human race, the full-truth, hard-work, free speech, press-&-profitsharing Moral ABC All-One-God-Faith, lightning-like, 6-billion strong, for we're All-One or none!
All-One-God-Faith, as teach the African shepherd-astronomers Abraham & Israel, for 6000-years, since the year 1: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!" - We're One!
All-One!

Only hard work unites all!
12th: Over-population destroys God's spaceship Earth, unless Essene controls limit all birth!
Who else but God gave man this sensuous passion.
Love that can spark mere dust to life!
Beauty in our Eternal Father's fashion!
Poetry, uniting All-One, brave, all life!
Who else but God can make Love last 1 trillion years of sweet eternities!
For when conquered after years of toil-sweat-blood, Love can strike like greased lightning sent by God to spark mere dust to intense blazing fire and create new Love-faith-hope-guts-strength, as only God inspire!
Unite the Human race in All-One-God-Faith, as all mankind desire!
Who else but God.
"An Army of Principles," wrote Thos.
Paine in 1799 "can penetrate when an army of soldiers can-not!
It will succeed where diplomacy may fail!
It will always construct & help unite One-God-Faith, where every other weapon divides the Human race!
The onslaught of such an Army of Principles cannot be stopped by the Rhine, the Channel or the ocean!
It's progress will match on the horizon of the world & it will conquer even tyranny, every Human heart by teaching every man the Moral ABC of the Free: Free to communicate-cooperate-construct!
Free to built, protect & share!
Free to grow, develop & expand!
Free to unite in love, cherish & enjoy the Kingdom, the dictatorship of God's law, uniting the whole Human race in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith!
For we're All-One or none: Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!"
AMerican democratic President Wilson, 1917, replaced Marxism by Lenin.
"We are not a nation of classes, races, minority or pressure groups!
Anybody trading on our race, color, nationality or religion is not yet American, does not yet deserve to enjoy the liberties of the Stars & Stripes!
He does not yet know, that the Army of Principles by America's Founding Father, the world's 1st steelbridge-builder, Thos.
Paine, since 1799, unites the whole Human race in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith!
Once we teach it, 6 billion strong, we're All-One!
"As teach Abraham-Israel-Moses-Buddha-Jesus & Mohammed, inspired every 76 yrs, by the messenger of God's law, the Messiah, Halley's Comet!
6000 yrs.
since the year One!
We're All-One!
All-One!
In '68 American Mao professor Marcuse upset Moscow's Czech power till Moscow's Press had the courage to confess: "Marx is god!
Marcuse his prophet!
Mao his sword!
50,000 American university professors, his disciples!
Black Panthers his killers!" What an apology we Rabbis owe Marx-Moscow, all Jews, all mankind, IRS slave, for our 2000 year failure to teach brave the constructive-selfish Moral ABC the real Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus to unite all mankind free!
The exact opposite to absolute-unselfish Marxism, that enslaves the Free!
Unless we teach the whole Human race the Moral ABC from uniting All-One-God-Faith, we're dead men on furlough from half-true hates!
From '29 to '79 we wired our "Public Servants" over 13,000 times to help unite the whole Human race in our Eternal Fathers' great All-One-God-Faith!
With the 8 great books by Thos.
Paine, suppressed since 1799: The Realist Declaration, The Age of Reason & The Army of Principles will instantly unite the whole Human race in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith: "LISTEN CHILDREN ETERNAL FATHER ETERNALLY ONE!" WE'RE ALL ONE!
The trouble is that the wrong people are always the most energetic, united & intense, dividing the hardworker to die in self-defense!
That fact alone brings Hitlers & Stalins to power & that fact will only change when we teach the whole Human race the Moral ABC of All-One-God-Faith, lightning-like, 6 billion strong & we're All-One!
All-One!
All-One!
As Israel teaches since the year One: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!" Exceptions?
None!

5th: Whatever unites mankind is better than whatever divides us!
Yet, if absolute-unselfish I am not for me, I'm nothing but classless, raceless, starving masses, never free nor brave!
Only if constructive-selfish I work hard perfecting first me, like arctic owls-penguin-pilot-cat-swallow-beaver, bee, can I teach the MORAL ABC's ALL-ONE-GOD-FAITH, that lightning-like unites the Human race!
For we're ALL-ONE OR NONE!
ALL-ONE!
"listen children eternal father eternally one!" EXCEPTIONS ETERNALLY?
ABSOLUTE NONE
6th: Absolute cleanliness is Godliness!
Balanced food for body-mind-soul-spirit is our medicine!
Full-truth our God, half-truth our enemy, hard work our salvation, unity our goal, free speech our weapon.
All-One our soul, self-discipline the key to love, uniting All-One above!
Above!
So, when your fellow man you measure, take him at his best, with that lever, lift him higher, overlook the rest!
For we're All-One or none!
As teach for 6000 years astronomers Abraham & Israel: "LISTEN CHILDREN ETERNAL FATHER ETERNALLY ONE!"
7th: Each swallow works hard to be perfect pilot-provider-builder-trainer-teacher-lover-mate, no half-true hate!
So, each day like a bird, perfect thyself first!
Have courage and smile my friend.
Think and act 10 years ahead!
And the man without fault?
He's dead!
Do one thing at a time, work hard!
Get done!
Then teach friend & enemy the Moral ABC that unites all mankind free!
Uniting One!
All-One!
Face the world with a smile, life is always worthwhile!
To the fearless are given crowns, keep out the past, disappointments won't last!
Help unite mankind, or we're wandering clowns!
Diligent preparation, precede...
spectacular restoration!!
So, help teach the whole Human race, the Moral ABC's All-One-God-Faith, lightning-like, for we're All-One or none!
All-One!!
10th: Thank God we don't descend down from perfect Adam & Eve to sinful sinner, brother's keeper, divided slave!
Thank God!
United, hard-working trained brave, from dust we ascend up!
Thank God for that!
Our brother's teacher of the Moral ABC, mason-tent-&-sandalmaker Hillel, taught Carpenter Jesus to unite all mankind free!
With it, every Human being created on God's Spaceship Earth, can evolve united, inspired-raised-trained-skilled-disciplined, guided lightning-like by a new birth!
Without it...
we destroy God's Spaceship Earth!
12th: A great teacher, must first, a self-supporting hard worker be, like Aleson-Baeck-Carnegie-Cousteau-Hammer-Liebman-Paine-Pike-Sange-Spinoza-Strauss-Szasz-Wilke-Yadin-Zamenhof, or he'll turn our greatest teaching into spades, to bury our people!
"All people!", added Carpenter Jesus entering manhood!
Manhood!
but, for 2000 years, we Rabbis never teach the Moral ABC the real Rabbi Hillel taught Jesus, to unite the Human race in our Eternal Father's great ALL-ONE-GOD-FAITH!
For we're All-One or none!
ALL-ONE!
For example: Einstein's Rabbi Levey evicted us from him University Princeton "Hillel Foundation", when we asked: "You agree, of course, that Hillel's hard-work-speech-press-&-profitsharing Moral ABC, unites the Human race in our Eternal Father's great ALL-ONE-GOD-FAITH!" The exact opposite to Marxist-Socialism, that does demoralize-divide-decay the whole human race today!
13th: "Knowing the full truth that unites the human race & not teaching all is deathly guilt!", learned carpenter Jesus from Mason Rabbi Hillel!
...
As Mao wrote in Redbook 51: "Marxist-Communism, once in power, is utterly unworkable, has less value than cowdung.
Its power is the gun!" ...
As teaches African-shepherd Astronomer Israel for 6000 years, "LISTEN CHILDREN ETERNAL FATHER ETERNALLY ONE!" For on God's Spaceship Earth, with Bomb & Gun, we're All-One or none!
All-One!
All-One!
Exceptions eternally?
Absolute none!

"The 2nd Coming of God's Law!
Mohammed's Arabs, 1948, found Israel Essene Scrolls & Einstein's "Hillel" prove that as no 6-year-old can grow up free without the ABC, so certain can no 12-year-old survive free without the Moral ABC mason, tent & sandalmaker Rabbi Hillel taught carpenter Jesus to unite all mankind free in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith!
For we're All-One or none: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!"

CLEOPATRA'S TEACHER OF ABSOLUTE LOVE; THE "ABC OF MAMA CAT;" WITH THE SWALLOW'S 10 DISCIPLINES ABOVE; THE ARCTIC WHITE OWL'S BIRTH-CONTROLLED LOVE!
Arctic White Owls by Birth-Control survive: the female does not go into heat until she sees three full months of frozen food her young ones to survive!
Putting to shame our welfare-state, with its untrained masses, enslaved by Marxist half-true hate!
Beavers, by family teamwork, stay alive!
Building dams, surviving the toughest winters without any welfare help to enjoy life!
Bees, once each year, drop three percent drone parasites from hive!
How else can life ascend-evolve-survive?
Cleopatra's Art of Love, evolved Egypt's Civilization 10,000 years back, based on the God-inspired "ABC of Mama Cat: Automatically, instinctively, each Mama Cat teaches her young ones from the moment of Birth: 1st: Absolute cleanliness is Godliness!
2nd: Constructive-selfish, build, protect and raise food, home, young!
3rd: Absolute teamwork fertilizes God's Earth!
4th: Absolute harmony with God's timing, easy birth!
5th: Mother's Love-discipline, joy, strength, praise!
6th: Father's stern-discipline!
7th: Hardworking self-discipline, brave!
8th: God's instinct-discipline, save!
9th: Absolute self-reliance!
Nine lives!
Strength, to carry on!
10th: Absolute dignity, beauty, relaxation, fun!
11th: Absolute tenacity gets it done!
12th: Absolute perfect sense of direction, ESP!
13th: Free, brave!
No Marxist slave!
Mama Cat's ABC of Love and the Swallow's Song inspired by the Kingdom of God's Law!
All-One!
Above!
Above!
All swallows evolve united to perfect pilots by full-truth, hard work, God's Law, trained brave!
No slave!
Brave!
Always evolving-united, free in All-One-God-Faith!
Hardworking, self-disciplined, no parasite-blackmail-welfare-slave!
Therefore brave we live to teach-work-love-inspire-unite!
All-One!
Win Victory!
Help get it done!
Teach to unite All-One!
All-One!
All-One!
For these are the days my friend, we know they'll never end!
We'll work-sing-dance-love marching on!
Marching on!
We'll teach how to Love God's Way!
We'll fight for it, OK!
For we're young and sure to unity All-One!
All-One!
All freedom loving children hate the word "Discipline!" Yet, self-discipline is the key to freedom!
Without it, even the most brilliant head remains useless, ineffective, small!
How basic is self-discipline?
Anthropologist, Margaret Mead, found Arctic Timberwolves litter abandoned, the mother probably killed.: "So, we put the timberwolf pups with our Dachshund mother, since she had only one pup of her own.
She raised the timberwolves.
Within three months, they were twice as large as their foster mother.
Now, when we threw a chunk of raw meat into the kennel, the pups attacked it ravenously, like timberwolves, but one grunt from their Dachshund mother, and they jumped back, stood still like a soldier at attention, waiting obediently until the Dachshund mother had eaten her fill, then with a loving grunt she gave them permission to go back and eat!"
That illustration of love-discipline was amazing; but any wild animal, bird or bee, has that self-discipline down to a "T", or there is no survival!
This proves we must replace, with The Moral ABC, our Marxist welfare state, or we won't survive free!
We perish by half-true hate!
Learn the Moral ABC to unite free: You Must Decide!
1st: Work hard to perfect thyself!
2nd: United-loving, armed-brave!
3rd: To teach all, every slave!
4th: The Moral ABC, 6 billion strong, with Essene Birth-Control, a trillion Israel-system fruit trees and "How to Love", with lightning-like uniting all free!
All-One!
Above!
Above.
With half-truth, slavery, barbarism gone!
Evolving-united, inspired-guided by full-truth, hard work, God's Law, Eternally One!
All-One!
All-One!

So go the 2nd mile, turn the other cheek, brave, not meet!
For we're All-one or none!
Exceptions eternally?
Absolute none!
3rd: For the University: A shark can only love its friend!
Lacking frontal lobes, it must fear-smear-slay-slander-dominate-dictate-distort or destroy anything it does not understand or disagrees with, that's a shark!
But a Human being knowing full-truth, the Kingdom of God's Law, must teach friend & enemy the Moral ABC to help unite all mankind free in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith, or that being is not yet Human, a traitor to God's Race!
4th: A Human being works hard to teach friend & enemy the Moral ABC that unites all mankind free in our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith, or that being is not yet Human!
Exceptions?
Absolute none!
5th: Don't hide your light under a bushel like the heathens, but let your light shine so forth that all mankind can see your good works to glorify our Eternal Father's Law, as taught through you!
For we're All-One or none!

Otherwise, one is still a beast, not yet Human!" Exceptions?
None!
(Bruschev, London 1956.)
7th: "We must teach friend & enemy, the whole Human race, the Moral ABC of our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-Faith or perish!

I am the manifestation of God's Law & so are you!
I have seen great wonders, but you shall see greater wonders!
I have done good work, but you shall do better work!
I have not come to change God's law, but we each came to find - follow - fulfill - print - protect - practice - preach - teach - unite & enjoy it!
Therefore, build you first the Kingdom of God's Law within you!
Memorize the Essene Moral ABC of the free, to never yield to half-true hate & everything you need shall be added unto you!
Search & you shall find!
Knock & it shall be opened!
Sow & you shall reap!
Work hard & you shall create.
Speak with Love, don't be afraid!

But remember, only those enjoy Eternal Life in our Almighty Father's Kingdom that had the courage to teach friend & enemy the Moral ABC that unites all mankind free in All-One-God-Faith: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!" Exceptions eternally?

All One!
Full-truth is God!
It must!
12th: God bless the persecuted!
They alone are His chosen people!
Those that did not suffer from persecution remained short-sighted, small!
Only those who united worked hard to survive ice-aged persecution evolved into Humane Beings, like Jesus - Mintz-Sills-Strauss-Szasz-Zamenhof, brave, to help teach all, every slave, the Moral ABC of All-One-God-faith, for we're All-One or none!

14th: Let him who is without fault throw the first stone, for only God is always perfect!
So, when your fellow man you measure, take him at his best, with that lever lift him higher, overlook the rest!
For we're All-One or none!
Remember, more good is caused by evil than by good.
So, do what's right!
Maximize the good, minimize the wrong!
Then the Kingdom of God's Law inspires-evolves-unites All-One!
All One!
All One!
15th: Let him who does not want to work with his hands, not eat with his hands either!
It will instantly cure every so-called mental ill by hard work, love-song-speech-press & profitsharing teamwork unite All One!
Since, if it's a shack from the weather, or a castle for a king, only by working together has mankind accomplished a thing!
"LISTEN CHILDREN ETERNAL FATHER ETERNALLY ONE!" EXCEPTIONS ETERNALLY?
ABSOLUTE NONE!
16th: Put Father, God's Law, back at the head of your family, or you have no family, nation, team!
For every organization is the shadow of one man, or there is no organization, no shadow, no man!
EXCEPTIONS?
NONE!
17th: Self-disciplined hard work is the skeleton of your intellect, the key to freedom, the basis of unity!
Without it, even the most brilliant head remains useless - ineffective - small!

Exceptions?

20th: God has not promised skies always blue; flower-strewn pathways all our lives through!
God has not promised sun without rain, peace without sorrow, joy without pain!
But God has promised strength for the day, rest for the laborer, light on the way, grace for the trial, help from above, undying sympathy, unfailing love!
Obey the Kingdom of God's Law uniting All-One above: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!
Exceptions?
Absolute None!
21st: Our new 6000 year young, love & teach love Brotherlove, that full-truth constructive good, that God within each & everyone of us, must today become more energetic, united & intense than our age-old fear-driven, kill or be killed Selflove, that jealous half-true power & glory seeking beast within us!
Selflove must service Brotherlove!
Half-true intolerant hate must be replaced by full-truth, hard work uniting ALL-ONE-GOD-FAITH!
22nd: Small minds decay!
Average minds delay!
Great minds teach All-One today!
So unite & all stand by you!
Divided, all deny you!
The only difference between the brave & the coward, is the brave has an ideal to fight for, the teaching the whole Human race our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-faith, as did the African astronomer Israel since the Year One: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!" Exceptions eternally?
Absolute none!

THE MORAL ABC, INTRODUCED BY KIPLING'S "IF" & SOAPMAKER BRONNER
If you can keep your head when all around you are losing theirs and blaming it on you!
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, and yet make allowance for their doubting too!
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about: don't deal in lies!
Or being hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise!
If you can dream and not make dreams your master!
If you can think and not make thoughts your aim!
If you can meet with triumph or disaster and treat those two imposters just the same!
If you can bear to hear the full-truth you have spoken twisted by crooks to make a trap for fools!
Or watch the things you have given your life to broken, and stoop to build them up again with worn out tools!
If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it at one turn of pitch or toss!
If you can force your heart, your nerve, your sinew, to serve you long after they are gone!
And so hold on although there is nothing left within you except that voice that says to them "Hold On!
Hold on!" If you can talk to crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings and not lose that common touch!
If neither loving friend nor enemy can hurt you; if all men count with you, but none too much!
If you can work hard to teach each unforgiving minute the Moral ABC, mason Hillel taught carpenter Jesus to unite all mankind free, come hell, hate, ban, you'll enjoy God's spaceship Earth & do great work within it; & which is more my son, you'll be a man!
A man!
A man!
Sure, East is East & West is West and never the twain shall meet!
But there is neither East nor West, nor border, breed nor birth, once the Moral ABC unites all mankind free on God's spaceship Earth!
Then & only then, no matter how rough the trip, how charged the scroll, you are the captain of thy ship, the master of thy soul!
Who else but God gave man this sensuous passion, Love that can spark mere dust to life!
Beauty in our Eternal Father's fashion!
Ecstasy far above Earthly greediness & strife!
Poetry, uniting All One, brave, all life!
Who else but God can make Love last 1 trillion years of sweet eternities!
For when conquered after years of toil, sweat, blood, Love can strike like greased lightning sent by God!
To spark mere dust to intense blazing fire & create the unity of God's spaceship Earth, as all mankind desire!
Bronner's Almond Soap quart poem teaches 'How to Love' uniting All-One above!
Above!
Who else but God!
Who else but God!
1st: If I'm not for me, who am I?
Nobody!
2nd: Yet, if I'm only for me, what am I?
Nothing!
3rd: If not now, when?
Once more: Unless constructive-selfish I work hard perfecting first me, absolute nothing can help perfect me!!
4th: Only hard work-God's Law can save us, but if we teach only our clan?
We're all hated then!
So, we must teach friend & enemy, the whole Human race, the full-truth, hard-work free speech, press & profitsharing Moral ABC's All-One-God-Faith, lightning-like, 6-billion strong, for we're All-One or none!
All-One-God-Faith, as teach the African shepherd astronomers Abraham & Israel, for 6000-yrs., since the yr.
1: "Listen Children Eternal Father Eternally One!" - We're All-One!
Exceptions eternally?
None!
To dream that impossible dream!
To reach that unreachable star!
'Till All-One, All-One we are!
To fight that unbeatable foe!
To go where the brave dare not go!
To right the unrightable wrong!
To love pure, chaste, from afar!
To try when your arms are too weary!
'Till All-One, All-One we are!
for this is my goal!
To reach that unreachable star!
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far!
To fight for the right without question or pause, to be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause!
For I know that if I follow this glorious quest, my heart will lie peaceful & calm when I'm laid to my rest!
And I know that the world will be better for this, that one man, tortured, blinded, covered with scars, still strove with his last ounce of courage, to reach that unreachable star 'til united All-One we are!
God, our Eternal Father, known of old, Lord over our far-flung Human race, beneath whole Eternal Law we hold dominion over land & space: Lord of nations, unite us yet by thy Law, the Essene Moral ABC of the free!
Lest we forget!
Lest we forget!
For fooling heart that puts its trust in manmade tube & iron sharp, all passing dust that builds on dust & guarding it calls not you to guard!
For frantic boast and foolish word, have mercy on thy people Lord!
A man & not a monkey: A Man!
Love is like a willful bird, do you want it?
It flies away!
Yet when you least expect its bliss, it turns around & it's here to stay!
For centuries man struggles half-asleep, half-living!
Small, jealous, bickering with mountains of red tape!
To be awakened the night God choose giving His great reward for hard work, poetry-unity-ecstasy-love-evolving man above the ape!
Poetry-unity-love evolving man above, above the ape!
Coincidentally & yet Oh-so-slow, sweet-kisses-whisper-softly into waiting ears; arousing heavenly flames that enlighten, renew, brilliant fires blazing through dark, lonesome years!
Who else but God gave man this sensuous passion, Love that can spark mere dust to life!
Passions that quicken your senses, fulfill; quench the thirst of lonesome years!
Yet the sun has shadows, learn to control your will; to enjoy life long happiness, not tears!
Wait!
Rise to the stars above & thrill!
Arouse the very flames of life!
Sweetheart, kill me: Hold still, hold still!
Listen to God's reward for strife!
Rosebuds, slowly woken, break budding open!
Delicate, sweet, so on soft fingertips; shivering up your spine!
Red pulsing blood; in lightning speed through your pure body's lips!
Caressing deep, searching, way out of sight; oh beautiful spirit of God's eternal Spring!
Heat of passion in a warm moonlit night ecstasy to be buried in heaven within, relax then to long dreamless sleep; body & soul join close in life's most brilliant bliss!
Revealing clarity-beauty-harmony-peace, sailing on far away sun-laden ships!
Yet-what-cunning-feminine-touch, can draw new desire to pulsing lips!
When soft-hands wander-casually-such, deftly down near lingering tips!
Who else but God gave man Love!
Like a beacon breaking through dark clouds that pass; your deep embrace, your sensuous kiss, who else but God can make Love last 1 trillion years of sweet eternities!
Who else but God!
We are not true, while calculated calm controls us; blood flows near spirit in cold divided flame!
ONly love's stormy passion, striking deep within us; can turn blood to spirit & spirit to blood, untamed!
Spirit to blood, untamed!
For God alone knows man's far distant future, towards which love's unfailing light shows clear the upward path, unity-harmony-peace!
Great tasks to nurture, with strength & knowledge, happiness can last!
Machine-age man is full of sense & nonsense!
Full-truth, half-truth, brotherlove, selflove, God & Beast!
Today this whole wide world needs love - faith - courage, the Moral ABC, once we teach it, lightning-like, 5 billion, we're All-One!

For we're all-one or none!
Exceptions eternally?
Absolute None!" Noah Webster.

WE unite the Human race in All-One-God-faith or perish by half-true hate!
For we're All-One or None!" Abraham Lincoln
93: "Government, like fire, is our most useful servant, if fully controlled by us, its Citizens; and government, exactly like fire, becomes our most destructive master if not fully controlled by the open majority of its productive working Citizens!
ONly united-armed-vigilant & trained, Swiss 6000 year Peace & Freedom reigned!
Exception?
None!" from 'The Army of Principles' by George Washington.
95: "I've never stooped so low as to hate any man!

It will always unite the Human race where all else divides All-One-God-Faith!" From American founding father, the world's first steel-bridge builder, Thomas Paine's 8 great books, not taught since 1799!
106: The trouble is that the wrong people are always the most energetic, united & intense; driving the hard-workers to lose in self-defense!
That fact alone brings Hitlers & Stalins to powerc & that will only change when we rally-raise-train-evolve-unite the whole Human race with the Moral ABC in All-One-God-Faith!
107: The intensity of man's emotions is a greater driving force and more decisive than the sum total of his education, his money, plus the size of his brain!
Proof: Einstein!

"HOW TO LOVE FOR LOVE IS GOD & GOD IS LOVE UNITING ALL-ONE ABOVE, ABOVE!"
by soapmaker Bronner

Who else but God gave man this sensuous passion,
Love that can spark mere dust to life!
Revealing beauty in our Eternal Father's fashion,
Poetry, uniting All-One, all brave, all life!
Who else but God!
Who else but God!

Have courage & smile!
Think & act 10 years ahead!
And the man without fault?
They killed him, he's dead!
Do one thing at a time!
Get set!
Start now!
Finish each job first, then teach love, here is how!

Love is like a willful bird!
Do you want it?
It flies away!
Yet when you least expect its bliss,
It turns around & it's here to stay!

For centuries, man struggles, half asleep, half living,
Small, jealous, bickering with mountains of red tape!
To be awakened the night God chose giving,
His great reward for hard work; Poetry-unity-love,
Evolving man above, above, above the ape!

Like a beacon breaking through dark clouds that pass,
Your deep embrace, your sensuous kiss, who else but God!
Can make love last 6000 years of sweet eternities!

Passions that quicken your senses, fulfill,
Quench the thirst of lonesome years!
Yet the sun has shadows, learn to control your will,
To enjoy life long happiness, not tears!

Wait!
Rise to the stars above & thrill!
Arouse the very flames of life!
Sweetheart, kiss me; Hold still, hold still!
Listen to God's reward for strife!

Coincidentally & yet Oh-so-slow,
Sweet-kisses-whisper-softly into waiting ears,
Arousing heavenly flames that enlighten renew,
Brilliant fire blazing through dark, lonesome years.

Rove when conquered after years of toil, sweat, blood,
Can strike like greased lightning sent by God!
To spark mere dust to intense blazing fire,
And create new love, faith-hope-guts-strength,
As only God inspire!
Create the unity of God's spaceship Earth,
Great life, as all mankind desire!

Relaxed then to long, dreamless sleep,
Body & soul join close in life's most brilliant blisse,
Revealing clarity-beauty-peace,
Sailing on far away sun-laden ships!

We are not true, while calculate calm controls us,
Blood flows near spirit in cold divided flame!
Only love's stormy passion, striking deep within us,
Can turn blood to spirit & spirit to blood, untamed!
Spirit to blood, untamed!

For God alone knows man's far distant future!
Towards which love's unfailing light,
Shows clear the upward path to Brotherhood-Peace!
Great tasks to nurture, with strength & knowledge,
Happiness can last!


God has not promised skies always blue
Flower strewn pathways all our lives through!
God has not promised sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain!
But God has promised strength for the day,
Rest for the laborer, light on the way!
Grace for the trial, help from above,
Undying sympathy, unfailing love!

GOD OUR ETERNAL FATHER!
By Rudyard kipling
(adapted by Bronner)

God our eternal Father, known of old,
Lord over our farflung human race,
Beneath whose eternal law we hold
Dominion over land and space -
Lord God of nations, unite us yet!
By thy law, the Essene Moral ABC of
the free Lest we forget - lest we forget!
Far called, our navies melt away;
On dune and headland sinks the fire:
Gone is all our pomp of yesterday,
Gone with Nineveh and Tyre,
Lord God of nations, unite us yet
By thy law, the Moral ABC of the free
Lest we forget, lest we forget!

The tumult and the shouting dies;
The captains and the kings depart;
Still stands your ancient sacrifice,
A humble and courageous heart.
Rod God of nations, unite us yet,
By thy law, the Moral ABC of the free
Lest we forget, lest we forget!
If, drunk with power, we should loose
Wild tongues that have not you in awe,
Such boastings as small children use,
Or Godless beasts outside thy law!

A PSALM OF LIFE
by Longfellow
(with small assist by Bronner)

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
-
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.
Life is real!
Life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul.
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each tomorrow
Find us farther than today.
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
And our hearts, though stout & brave,
Still, like muffled drums, are
beating Funeral marches to the grave.

In the world's broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of Life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
But a hero in the strife!
Trust no Future, however pleasant!
Let the dead Past bury its dead!
Act, - act in the living Present!
Heart within, and God overhead!

Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time;
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing over life's solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.

Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart of any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and searn to write
Til we rally, raise, unite!
In our Eternal Father's great All-One-God-faith.
All-One!
Unite.


FULL-TRUTH, GOD'S LAW, SHALL MAKE YOU FREE!
BY GEOFREY CHAUCER and SOAPMAKER BRONNER

Flee from the crowd & dwell with truthfulness.
Be satisfied with what you have, it may be small.
To hoard brings hate, to climb brings dizziness.
The crowd has envy and success blinds all.
Be happy with what to your lot may fall.
Work well yourself to counsel others clear.
And full-truth, hard work, God's Law, shall make you free!
There is no fear!

Torment yourself not, all the crooked to redress, Nor put your trust in fortune's turning ball.
Great peace is found in little busyness.
And war but kicks against an age-old wall!
Strive not you earthen pot to break that wall!
Subdue yourself and others you shall hear!
And full-truth, hard work, God's Law, shall make you free!
There is no fear!

What God does send, receive in glad-wholesomeness!
To strive for greater wealth foretells they fall.
Here is no home, here is but Wilderness.
Forth pilgrim, forth!
Up beast & leave thy stall!
Know your country, look up!
Thank God for all!
Hold to the higher way, your soul, that God within you!
Be pioneer!
And full-truth, hard work, God's Law, shall make you free!
There is no fear!

Therefore, poor beast, forsake thy wretchedness!
No longer let this world be thy stall.
His mercy seek, who in his mightiness, made you of dust, but not be a ball!
Work well yourself and work for all, who seek for larger life and deeper cheer!
And full-truth, hard work, God's Law, shall make you free!
There is no fear!
